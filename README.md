- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rakghar
- 👀 I’m interested in fixing a handler file for Dying Light 2 with Nucleus Coop.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... starting from scratch, really into coop and just discovered Nucleus Coop. And then Dying Light stopped working last update 11/2023.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... I can't really, to noob
- 📫 How to reach me ... Add me on steam maybe?
